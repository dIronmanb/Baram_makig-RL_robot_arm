# Baram making: Reinforcement Learning robot arm 
- Robot arm operating in two-dimensional plane
- 3 motors (3 degrees of freedom)

# Environment
-  Create a Custom Environment with OpenAI's Gym Module
-  The simulation is planned to be linked with `pygame` later...
-  Use `UDP Protocol` to exchange values with my computer and server because of resources being used externally
(To hand over the actual value of the robot...to be continued!)
